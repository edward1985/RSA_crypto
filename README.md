# RSA_crypto
Including : RSA AES Base64 Sha256 

You can find the example just before the functions.

It implement one class Prsa, and all function is tested.


BTW: It still used openssl for RSA, Because I still can't be sure that I can do RSA more efficient... I will not use openssl in my next project.
